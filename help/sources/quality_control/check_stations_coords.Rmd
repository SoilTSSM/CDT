To check if the stations do not include missing or unlikely coordinates, duplicated coordinates or stations located outside a specified region, go to `r menuselection('Quality Control','Check Stations Coordinates')`.

`r put.image("images/quality_control/check_coords/check_crds.png", height = 50, width = 50)`

1. Select the file containing the station data in CDT format. If the file is not yet listed, use the button `r button('...')` to open it.
2. Select the country boundaries or any administrative boundaries shapefiles to be used to check whether stations are located outside it.
3. Enter the full path to directory to save the result, or browse it from `r button('...')`.
4. Specify the distance from the boundaries in kilometer, all stations located beyond this distance will be flagged as outside.

When you have finished filling all required inputs, click on `r button('&nbsp;&nbsp;  OK  &nbsp;&nbsp;')` and then click on the button ![][executetask] in the toolbar to run the verification.

`r put.image("images/quality_control/check_coords/check_crds_rpanel.png", height = 40, width = 40)`

To display the results of the verification and correct any errors on the station coordinates, click on `r button('View/Edit Results')` located on the left panel. A table containing the missing, unlikely, duplicated and outside coordinates will be displayed.

`r put.image("images/quality_control/check_coords/check_crds_result.png", height = 60, width = 60)`

The first column contains a description of the issues found concerning that location. The results are classified into three categories:

- __Missing Coordinates__: longitude and/or latitude are missing
- __Duplicate Coordinates__: there is more than one station that has the same coordinates
- __Coordinates Outside__: the station is located outside the given administrative boundaries

To correct the wrong coordinates, change the corresponding longitude (3rd column) and latitude (4th column).
To remove a station, right-click on the left column containing the row number/names corresponding to this station then select `r menuselection('Delete selected row')`

`r put.image("images/quality_control/check_coords/pop-menu.png", height = 40, width = 40)`

When you finish editing the table, click on the button ![][savetable] in the toolbar to save the table, then click on the button `r button('Correct Coordinates')` in the left panel to correct the coordinates.

 >  **OUTPUT:** Under the directory you specified to save the result (3), a directory named **ChkCoord\_**<*Input station data filename without extension*> has been created, there are two files inside this directory:
 >  - <*Input station data filename without extension*>\_**2CORRECT**\_**STATIONS.txt**: containing the information about the stations to be corrected.
 >  - <*Input station data filename without extension*>\_**CHECKED**\_**STATIONS.txt**: a CDT data for the corrected coordinates.
