# Climate Data Tools
Climate Data Tools (CDT) is a  set of tools for meteorological data quality control, homogenization and merging station data with satellite and others proxies.

## Installation

CDT needs Tcl/Tk to work properly. The easiest way to get Tcl/Tk installed is via ActiveState's free ActiveTcl distribution, which includes precompiled versions of not only the core Tcl and Tk, but dozens of extensions. You can download ActiveTcl from ActiveState's websites [https://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads](https://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads).
